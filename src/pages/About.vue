            Hi there! I'm Thu Nguyen, born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
            and now based in Texas, United States.<br /><br />
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve discovered my passion for
            technology and problem-solving and I am excited to pursue a career
            in software engineering. As I begin my early career, I'm eager to
            find opportunities that allow me to learn continuously and grow in
            this ever-changing field. I look forward to using my skills and
            enthusiasm to make a meaningful impact in software development and
            contribute positively to the world around me.
            <br /><br />
            I recently worked on desktop applications, web development, gaining experience in both
            front-end and back-end technologies. Some of the tech stacks I’ve
            been using include JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET, MySQL, and REST APIs,
            along with a foundational knowledge of many other technologies.
